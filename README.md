# Mine-vs-Rock
In this Machine learning project I tried to show that how a submarine can detect whether a thing is mine or rock.If it can detect then it can escape from that object easily.
I used sonar data where is 61 columns and almost 208 rows. There is no header. using logistics regression to find our binary prediction and used accuracy to evaluate model accuracy.
